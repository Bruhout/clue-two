        Isn't it fascinating ? This little game on the web that will remain for decades, maybe after we are gone ? We might have a huge fight and never talk again, and the game will still remain. Two people playing a game of puzzles in some secluded corner of the world, their exploits up for the world to find, and for the world to see.<br> Everyday, it seems like we change the world.<br> In any case, click on and move ahead.
